#Clustering and Segmentation Analysis of Vehicles and Customers
Project Summary
This project focuses on clustering analysis using data from vehicles and customers to identify groups with similar characteristics. Techniques such as normalization, distance matrix calculation, hierarchical and agglomerative clustering were applied, along with visualizations to interpret the results.

Customer Segmentation (K-Means)
Segmentation into 3 clusters based on Age, Education, and Income.

2D and 3D visualizations to understand grouping behavior.

2D Visualization of Customer Segmentation


3D Visualization of Customer Segmentation


Vehicle Clustering Analysis
Data cleaning and normalization of relevant variables.

Calculation of Euclidean distance matrix.

Hierarchical and agglomerative clustering to group vehicles.

Cluster assignment added to the dataset.

Hierarchical Clustering Dendrogram


Vehicle Clusters Scatter Plot
X-axis: Horsepower (horsepow)
Y-axis: Fuel Efficiency (mpg)
Point Size: Price (price)
Color: Assigned Cluster
Each point is labeled with the vehicle model.



Conclusion
The analysis allowed for the identification of homogeneous groups of customers and vehicles, supporting more effective segmentation strategies and personalized marketing.

How to Run
Open and run the notebook machine_learning.ipynb with the required libraries installed to reproduce the full analysis and generate the charts.
